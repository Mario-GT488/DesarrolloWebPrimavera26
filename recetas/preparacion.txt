Pizza

Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, whole or in portion-size slices. Methods 
have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce 
from combining with the dough, and producing a crust that can be frozen and 
reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and 
self-rising crusts.
Pasta

Ingredients to make pasta dough include semolina flour, egg, salt and water. 
Flour is first mounded on a flat surface and then a well in the pile of flour is 
created. Egg is then poured into the well and a fork is used to mix the egg and 
flour.[46] There are a variety of ways to shape the sheets of pasta depending on 
the type required. The most popular types include penne, spaghetti and macaroni.
