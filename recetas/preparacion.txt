Pizza

Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, whole or in portion-size slices. Methods 
have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce 
from combining with the dough, and producing a crust that can be frozen and 
reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and 
self-rising crusts.
