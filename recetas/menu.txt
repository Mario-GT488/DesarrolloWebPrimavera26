Pasta

Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour 
mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by 
boiling or baking. Pasta was originally only made with durum, although the 
definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a gluten-free diet, such 
as rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils. Pasta is believed to have 
developed independently in Italy and is a staple food of Italian cuisine, with 
evidence of Etruscans making pasta as early as 400 BCE in Italy.
